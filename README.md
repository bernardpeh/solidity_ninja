# Tutorial 5 - The frontend

Create a one-pager frontend for tutorial 4 (the crowd funding project).

Users are expected to have metamask installed.

Testrpc credentials just in case:

```
testrpc -m "enlist illness roast pair check danger drill noble dove repeat great margin"
```
## Business Rules

* All users should see all projects in the browser.
* All users can create new projects after filling in the compulsory fields.
* All users can fund any projects using any amount of ether, but not greater than the fund limit set by the project creator.
* Funded projects should be removed from the listings in the browser.

## Functional Test

same as tutorial 4
